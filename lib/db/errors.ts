// READING POSTGRESQL'S ERRORS. When the database refuses a change, the
// Neon driver throws an error carrying PostgreSQL's five-character SQLSTATE
// code and the name of the constraint that refused. The repos and services
// turn the ones we expect into ServiceErrors (lib/services/errors.ts);
// anything else is re-thrown, logged with the request id, and answered with
// a plain 500 that never contains the SQL or a stack trace.
//
// Letting the database decide, then explaining, is deliberate. "Check
// first, then write" has a gap: another request can slip in between the
// check and the write. A constraint can't be raced.
