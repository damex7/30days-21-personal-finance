// USER QUERIES. Every read and write of the users table goes through here.
//
// Rules (the same as Day 16's lib/notes.ts):
// - Every value reaches SQL as a PARAMETER (${value} in the sql`` tagged
//   template). No string concatenation, ever.
// - Every row coming back is checked with Zod (lib/rows.ts).
// - password_hash only leaves this file through the *WithHash functions,
//   which only the login and password checks call. Pages never see it.
// - A change and the audit event describing it are written in ONE
//   statement or transaction, so neither can happen without the other.
