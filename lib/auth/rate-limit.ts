// RATE LIMITING: "at most N attempts per window", counted in PostgreSQL.
//
// Why rate limiting and not ACCOUNT LOCKOUT ("3 wrong passwords and the
// account is locked until you call support")? Lockout hands every stranger
// a button that locks YOU out: they just type your email with wrong
// passwords. A rate limit only slows guessing down: after 5 tries the next
// one waits up to 15 minutes, which turns millions of guesses into a few
// hundred a day, while you can still get in once the window passes (or
// right away with a password reset link).
//
// We count per IP address AND per email:
// - per IP stops one machine guessing passwords for many accounts;
// - per email stops many machines (a botnet) guessing one account.
//
// Why Postgres and not memory: see db/migrations/005_rate_limits.sql.
