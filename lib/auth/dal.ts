// THE DATA ACCESS LAYER (DAL): the ONE place that decides "who is this, and
// are they allowed?". Every protected page, Server Action and route handler
// starts by calling verifySession() or requireRole() from here.
//
// Why here and not only in proxy.ts? The proxy runs before a page and only
// checks that a cookie EXISTS (it can't afford a database trip on every
// request, including images and prefetches). An expired, revoked or forged
// cookie passes that check. Also, Server Actions are POST requests to the
// page's URL, and a bug in a matcher can silently skip a route. So the proxy
// is a convenience for fast redirects; the real check is here, next to the
// data, every time.

 * request starts fresh, so a revoked session is rejected right away.
 *
 * Why not 'use cache: private' (which the Next.js docs suggest for session
 * reads)? That keeps the result in the BROWSER for up to 5 minutes, so a
 * session revoked from another device would keep working here for those 5
 * minutes. For a security decision we want every request to ask the database.
