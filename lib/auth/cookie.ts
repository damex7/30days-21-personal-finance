 * In production the name starts with "__Host-". Browsers only accept a
 * cookie with that prefix if it is Secure, has Path=/ and has NO Domain
 * attribute. So no other site, and no subdomain of ours, can plant or
 * overwrite it (a "cookie tossing" attack). In development the plain name is
 * used, because Safari refuses Secure cookies on http://localhost.

/**
 * The flags, each one a separate protection:
 *
 * - httpOnly: JavaScript in the page can't read the cookie (document.cookie
 *   doesn't show it). If an attacker ever gets a script onto a page (XSS),
 *   they still can't copy the session token and use it elsewhere.
 * - secure: the browser only sends it over HTTPS, so nobody on the café
 *   Wi-Fi can read it in transit. Off in development (plain http://localhost).
 * - sameSite 'lax': the browser does NOT attach the cookie to requests that
 *   other sites make in the background (a hidden form POST, an image, a
 *   fetch). It still does on a normal link click, so arriving from an email
 *   or a search result keeps you signed in. That blocks most cross-site
 *   request forgery (CSRF). 'strict' would also drop it on link clicks, so
 *   every arrival from another site would look signed out.
 * - path '/': sent with every page on the site, not just one folder.
 * - maxAge: how long the BROWSER keeps it. The database's expires_at is what
 *   actually decides whether the session is valid.
