//
// Applies every db/migrations/NNN_*.sql file that hasn't been applied yet, in
// filename order, and records each one in schema_migrations so it never runs
// twice. Run it as often as you like: with nothing new to apply it does
// nothing.
//
// WHY MIGRATIONS INSTEAD OF EDITING TABLES BY HAND in the Neon console:
// - Every database (yours, a teammate's, a preview branch, production) ends
//   up with the SAME schema, built by the same steps in the same order.
// - The schema's history lives in git next to the code that needs it, so a
//   commit that adds a column also adds the migration that creates it.
// - A fresh database is rebuilt with one command instead of from memory.
//
// Runs with Node's built-in TypeScript support (no build step), so it uses
// only "erasable" TypeScript: type annotations, no enums or namespaces.
